**The Challenge**

Starting from scratch is both exciting and daunting. At my previous role, I was tasked with designing a compensation tool. However, there was no clear vision or roadmap, and plans seemed to shift weekly. This constant pivoting created uncertainty, but it also gave us room to explore.

We started with some key questions:

•	How can compensation play a more effective role in hiring and retaining talent?

•	What if we could build a tool to decide all compensation numbers in one place, irrespective of the tools being used?

•	How can we help managers make objective and ethical compensation decisions?

•	Can AI help simulate budgets, offering tailored compensation options for business units and teams?

**Where We Began**

The journey wasn’t conventional. While we adhered to some standard practices, we took risks, made decisions collaboratively, and prioritized validating ideas quickly. Here’s how we got started:

•	**Stakeholder Study:** We interviewed key stakeholders to understand their vision, potential buyer personas, and ideal processes.

•	**Survey Research:** We conducted surveys to uncover how structured organizations currently manage compensation.

**Key Insights**

After discussions with stakeholders and a few interested salespeople, a core insight emerged:

Managers and team owners lack a **centralized, user-friendly tool** to make fair and ethical compensation decisions.

These insights shaped our **primary goals**:

•	**Streamline compensation cycles.**

•	**Improve decision-making visibility** through automation and data-driven insights.

**Defining the Solution**

**1. Our Hypothesis**

Current compensation tools are complex, time-consuming, and lack actionable insights aligned with budgets and retention goals. A new tool could simplify this process.

**2. Key Features Designed**

•	**Centralized Platform:** Unified access to all compensation data.

•	**Budget Simulation with AI:** Simulate multiple scenarios for informed decisions.

•	**Objective Insights:** Offer managers data-driven, fair, and compliant recommendations.

**Navigating Ambiguity**

**How I Brought Clarity to the Team**

•	**Collaboration:** Regular syncs with stakeholders to validate ideas and adjust priorities.

•	**Transparency:** Documenting and communicating evolving requirements clearly.

•	**Iterative Design:** Rapid prototyping and user feedback loops to refine the solution.

**Impact and Results**

**Quantitative Outcomes**

•	Reduced time spent on compensation planning by X%.

•	Increased user satisfaction by Y%.

**Qualitative Feedback**

Managers reported feeling more confident and objective in their decisions.

🖼️ **Placeholder for data visualization:** Include charts, metrics, or testimonials.

**Challenges and Learnings**

**Challenges Faced**

•	Balancing between evolving requirements and delivering quickly.

•	Addressing the lack of an initial clear vision.

**Key Learnings**

•	Early stakeholder alignment is crucial.

•	Iterative design ensures flexibility without losing sight of the goals.

**Next Steps**

While the initial version of the tool achieved significant milestones, we identified areas for future improvements:

•	**Predictive Insights:** Incorporating advanced AI to forecast long-term budget impacts.

•	**Scalability:** Adapting the tool for organizations of varying sizes.

**Reflections**

Designing a zero-to-one product taught me how to navigate ambiguity and bring clarity to complex challenges. It was a rollercoaster ride, but by focusing on stakeholder needs and iterative development, we built something impactful.
